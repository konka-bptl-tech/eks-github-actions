Here‚Äôs a clear **question and answer** pair for your scenario, framed in a way suitable for interviews or documentation:

### ‚ùì**Question:**

I created an Amazon EKS cluster using Terraform, and it automatically created a security group that only allows inbound traffic from itself. I launched a bastion EC2 instance in a public subnet of the same VPC and tried accessing the EKS cluster using `kubectl` from the bastion. However, the connection to the EKS API server fails with a timeout error.

Surprisingly, I‚Äôm able to access the same EKS cluster from my personal Windows machine using `kubectl`, even though the EKS security group doesn‚Äôt allow public access explicitly. Why does it work from my local machine but not from the bastion in the same network?

### ‚úÖ**Answer:**

This happens because of how **EKS endpoint access** is configured:

When an EKS cluster is created with **public endpoint access enabled**, the EKS control plane is accessible over the **internet**, and access is authenticated using IAM credentials‚Äînot security groups. That‚Äôs why your local Windows machine can access the EKS cluster API, even if its security group doesn't allow public traffic ‚Äî because it goes through the **public endpoint** (`*.eks.amazonaws.com`).

However, when you access the EKS API from an EC2 bastion inside the VPC, AWS tries to route traffic through the **private endpoint** of the EKS cluster (if enabled). This means:

* Your **bastion uses the internal VPC route** to reach the EKS control plane.
* The **cluster‚Äôs SG must explicitly allow inbound TCP on port 443** from the bastion‚Äôs IP, subnet CIDR, or security group.
* Since the default EKS security group only allows traffic from itself, the bastion‚Äôs traffic is blocked ‚Äî resulting in a **timeout**.

---

### üîß Solution:

To allow access from the bastion host, you have two options:

1. **Add a security group rule** to the EKS control plane SG:

   ```hcl
   Type: HTTPS
   Port: 443
   Source: <bastion's SG or subnet CIDR>
   ```

2. Alternatively, if using public access:

   * Ensure the **public endpoint is enabled**, and
   * Add the **VPC CIDR block** or **0.0.0.0/0 (for testing only)** to the **public access CIDR allow list**.

---

### ‚úÖ Recommendation:

For production environments, it's best to use **private endpoint access** and:

* Add interface VPC endpoints for EKS API.
* Secure access using fine-grained **security group rules**.
